#+TITLE: bibslurp.el --- retrieve BibTeX entries from NASA ADS

* Example usage:
  1. add an entry to a bibtex buffer:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x bibslurp-query-ads RET ^Quataert 2008 RET
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     Move to the abstract you want to cite with =n= and =p= keys, or search in
     the buffer with =s= or =r=, and then press
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     RET
     q
     C-y
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     If you want to select a different abstract, just type the corresponding
     number before pressing =RET=:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     15 RET
     q  
     C-y
     #+END_EXAMPLE

* Description:
  Creating a BibTeX file is one of the more tedious aspects of writing
  a paper.  The NASA ADS system (http://adswww.harvard.edu/) helps a
  lot by making bibliography data available and easy to find, but
  there's still the matter of copying and pasting it into your local
  database.  Since I find that process annoying, I wrote =BibSlurp=, a
  set of emacs functions to speed it along.

  BibSlurp enables you to query nasa ads without leaving emacs.  As an
  example, typing =M-x bibslurp-query-ads RET white rees RET= brings up
  the following buffer: (the search string is sent directly to ADS, so
  things like =^white rees= or =^white 1978= will also work as
  expected.)

  #+ATTR_HTML: alt="search-results" title="search-results" width="602" height="856"
  [[file:images/search-results.png]]

  Let's say I want to add the second paper to my =.bib= database.  All I have to
  do is hit =2 RET= (or simply =RET= if point is on that entry).  After waiting
  for the appropriate files to download, =BibSlurp= responds with the message
  =saved bibtex entry to kill ring=.

  #+ATTR_HTML: alt="saved-to-kill-ring" title="saved-to-kill-ring" width="432" height="295" class="pad bottom left"
  [[file:images/saved-to-kill-ring.png]]

  From here, hitting =q= takes me back to my =.bib= file, where I can
  yank the entry with =C-y=: (note that bibslurp automatically
  generates a label for the entry)
  
  #+ATTR_HTML: alt="yanked-entry" title="yanked-entry" width="602" height="466"
  [[file:images/yanked-entry.png]]

  If I'm not sure which paper I want, I can pull up the abstract by hitting =2
  a= (or simply =a= if point is already on the wanted abstract).  From there,
  =q= takes me back to the search results.

  #+ATTR_HTML: alt="abstract-view" title="abstract-view" width="602" height="466"

** Advanced search
   You can turn to the ADS advanced search interface, akin to
   http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html, either by pressing =C-c C-c=
   after having issued =bibslurp-query-ads=, or directly with =M-x
   bibslurp-query-ads-advanced-search RET=.  Here you can fill the wanted search
   fields (authors, publication date, objects, title, abstract) and specify
   combination logics, and then send the query either with =C-c C-c= or by
   pressing the button =Send Query=.  Use =TAB= to move through fields, and =q=
   outside an input field to quit the search interface.

** Other features
   In the ADS search result buffer you can also visit some useful pages related
   to each entry:
   - on-line data at other data centers, with =d=
   - on-line version of the selected article, with =e=
   - on-line articles in PDF or Postscript, with =f=
   - lists of objects for the selected abstract in the NED database, with =N=
   - lists of objects for the selected abstract in the SIMBAD database, with =S=
   - on-line pre-print version of the article in the arXiv database, with =x=
   For each of these commands, =BibSlurp= will use by default the abstract point
   is currenly on, but you can specify a different abstract by prefixing the
   command with a number.  For example, =7 x= will fire up your browser to the
   arXiv version of the seventh abstract in the list.

* Installation:
  Use package.el. You'll need to add MELPA to your archives:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
  #+END_SRC

  Alternatively, you can just save this file and do the standard
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/bibslurp.el")
  (require 'bibslurp)
  #+END_SRC

  Note that =bibslurp= requires the [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s]] and [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]] libraries.  If you
  install bibslurp manually, you need to make sure you also have
  these in place.

  You might consider giving it a keybinding, e.g.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x M-b") 'bibslurp-query-ads)
  #+END_SRC

* TODO:
  1. clean up code
  2. check regexp robustness
